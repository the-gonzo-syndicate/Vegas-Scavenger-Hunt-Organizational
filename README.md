## Overview
### Description
Vegas Scavenger Hunt is an iOS Application created with Swift, by a student organization of The College of Southern Nevada. The app will lead users on various themed scavenger hunts throughout Las Vegas. They will take pictures of the required areas, earning points and badges for each place they visit. This would lead to many opportunities for advertising of nearby businesses and attractions.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Travel & Tourism / Interactive Gaming.
- **Mobile:** Uses camera and location data, mobile only.
- **Story:** Allows users to search Las Vegas for stops on defined scavenger hunts, where upon the user can log their stop, take a         picture, and gain points on the leaderboard. 
- **Market:** It will be heavily marketed towards the Travel and Tourism industry, which Las Vegas caters to around 40 million tourists   a year. It will aid in giving tourists who often do not know what to do in Las Vegas a multitude of exciting goals to achieve, but yet   will also be challenging for locals as well. Eventually would love to add advertisements and featured stops. 
- **Habit:** Users can gain points for the various stops they visit, and complete entire scavenger hunts, which can be quite addicting.   Being able to see your progress on a leaderboard of others will also add to it's addictiveness.
- **Scope:** The scope is focused to showing people interesting places and sights in Las Vegas from a tourism standpoint, but can also     be used to deliver advertising and specials at nearby establishments.
